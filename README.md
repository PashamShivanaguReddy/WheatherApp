# 🌤️ WheatherApp
A clean and simple weather application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Users can search for any city to get real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This project was created to practice making API calls and dynamically updating the UI.

✨ Key Features That Stand Out:

    🌍 Global City Search: Simply type a city name and get instant, accurate weather updates from around the world.
    
    📡 Real-Time Data: Powered by reliable weather APIs (like OpenWeatherMap), ensuring you always have the most current information at your fingertips.
    
    🌡️ Comprehensive Metrics: Beyond just temperature, get detailed insights including humidity (💧), wind speed (🌬️), and a dynamic weather condition icon (☁️, ☀️, 🌧️).
    
    ✨ Stunning & Clean UI: Experience a modern, minimalist design that's both visually appealing and incredibly easy to navigate.
    
    ⚡ Blazing Fast Performance: Built with efficiency in mind for a smooth and responsive user experience.

🛠️ Built With Passion & Precision (Tech Stack):

    HTML5 🌐: The structural backbone, ensuring robust and semantic content.
    
    CSS3 🎨: Crafting a beautiful and responsive user interface with modern styling techniques.
    
    JavaScript 💡: Bringing the app to life with dynamic interactions, API fetching, and DOM manipulation.
